# Wolf-OS

Created using HTML5, Electron, and Javascript. Wolf OS is a cool OS that has prebuilt-in apps and features you may like. Fully customizable through the code, and you can move apps around to your liking. There is Free and Premium login accounts both going to a different page so that you can have the best while your kids and/or friends have the not-so-good one.

# Setup

1) Download full code
2) Unzip the file by double clicking it or riht clicking and choose open with...

# Running code

type in `cd /Your/Directory/Goes/Here`

then, after you have connected to the directory of wolf-os folder you got from the unzipping, enter this to start:

`./start.sh`

You should have a window popup and go into fullscreen mode, so you can use it like an OS. You can exit the fullscreen by using the top bar on your macbook. For windows it is wierder, you have to right click or use the shortcut command. 

Overall, you should have a nice time using it, and it will be useful for when you want your kid to have restrictions with a easy-to-use platform! Please enjoy the OS and if you want, later i can release a newer version, like i did with device puller pro.
